        <p>A sushi bowl is a vibrant and flavorful dish that combines sushi rice, fresh raw fish or seafood, assorted vegetables, and delectable toppings, creating a convenient and satisfying alternative to traditional sushi rolls.</p>
    <h4>Ingridients for two</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>200g sushi rice</li>
            <li>30 ml rice vinegar</li>
            <li>7.5g of sugar</li>
            <li>1g of salt</li>
            <li>100g smoked or marinated sushi-grade fish (such as tuna, salmon)</li>
            <li>2 sliced cucumbers</li>
            <li>Half sliced avocado</li>
            <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
            <li>30g edamame beans</li>
            <li>15ml soy sauce</li>
            <li>7.5ml sesame oil</li>
            <li>7.5g toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed sheets, cut into thin strips (optional)</li>
        </ul>
           
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the sushi rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve. Remove from heat and let the vinegar mixture cool.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the sushi rice and gently fold it in using a wooden spoon or spatula. Be careful not to smash the rice; you want to coat it evenly with the vinegar mixture.</li>
            <li>Prepare your toppings by slicing the cooked and seasoned sushi-grade fish into bite-sized pieces. Slice the cucumber and avocado into thin strips. Grate the carrot.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce and sesame oil.</li>
            <li>To assemble the sushi bowls, divide the seasoned sushi rice between two serving bowls. Top with the sliced fish, cucumber, avocado, edamame beans and carrot.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the soy sauce and sesame oil mixture over the sushi bowls. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and nori seaweed strips, if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve the sushi bowls with wasabi and additional soy sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
<p>Enjoy your homemade sushi bowls for two! Feel free to adjust the quantities of ingredients according to your taste preferences.</p>
